	Calculated Profit1, profit2, Gross profit from the following formula by using lambda function
     profit1= gross - budget

     gross_profit=((gross-budget)/(budget)) * 100

	Produced the result of best pair actor and directors based on the imdb_ratings
	Created the result of best pair actor and directors average ratings
